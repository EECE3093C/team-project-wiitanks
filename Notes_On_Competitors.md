# Thinking about the competition:
I thought it would be a great starting place to take some time and explore some existing multiplayer and singleplayer tank games. 
By goal is to collect several points of information about what has been done before, what features are fun to play with, and
what features are not fun to play with. I hope that by gathering data on similar products, I can use this data to expidite the 
development process.

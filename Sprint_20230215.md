  Our product is a multiplayer video game. This game is a player vs player arena game

### • Whom is it for?
  
  Our product is for groups of friends or coworkers that wish to play a game online

### • What problem does it solve?

  Our product solves the problem that there is a severe lack of user-interactivity in the modern game industry.

Our customers can play where ever they have the game file and connections to other computers.

There are a few competitors to our product. Notably, Wii Tanks is an arena multiplayer game. There are several mobile games that have very similiar gameplay.

### • What is novel in your approach, that is why is this project compelling and worth
developing?

### • Describe the specific data you will access/store.

We will directly ask for certain user data, including a username. We will also track certain data about player performance, including hit-rate.

### • What languages/toolkits do you intend to use for the
development? 

We plan on using Godot to develop our product. We will use the built-in, python-like, Godot language.

schedule?

The single most serious challenge we see in developing the product would be developing a robust and effecient means of communication between players.

# Sprint 1:

### • What is your product (high-level view)?

  Our product is a multiplayer video game. This game is a player vs player arena game in which each player controls a tank. The game is viewed from a top-down view and the players are tasked with shoothing the other tanks, until only one player remains. Our game will include exciting variations in gameplay, including unique powerups and several different levels to choose from. Further, our game will operate on a local network. Our product also includes a distinct component that allows interested players to design their own levels.

### • Whom is it for?
  
  Our product is for groups of friends that want a more customizable gaming experience. We believe that there is a substaintial market for the young adults that feel nostaglic for the early-internet days of LAN gaming parties. With this in mind though, our product would also be fun for just about anyone interesting in playing games with friends.

### • What problem does it solve?

  Our product solves the problem that there is a severe lack of user-interactivity in the modern game industry. Our product allows passionate gamers the freedom to modify the settings and rules of the game. Further, by designing our product to operate on local networks, we are completely removing the reliance on big game servers. Our customers can play where ever they have the game file and connections to other computers.

### • What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?

There are a few competitors to our product. Notably, Wii Tanks is an arena multiplayer game. There are several mobile games that have very similiar gameplay as well.

### • What is novel in your approach, that is why is this project compelling and worth developing? 

The key difference between our competitors and our approach is how accessible and customizable our product is. Because we allow users to create levels and modify how the game plays, we are lowering the barrier of entry for aspiring game developers. Further, our product does not rely on large game servers, allowing users to host their own games, avoiding potential paywalls and eventual los of support for online servers.


### • Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.

Godot is a game development platform with several online tutorials showing how to create local network games. So, using these tutorials, it is clear that the product can be built with the reasonable use of available resources. Further, creating a map creation tool to go with our game is achievable, since there are several tutorials online about how to do this.

### • Describe at a very high level the system's architecture, identifying the components/modules that will interact.

At a high level, there are a few components of our product to consider. First, we will have a setup module that will handle the start screen, player details, and map selection. Once a game is launched, we will have a game logic module. This will handle player inputs and game physics/interactions. The game logic module will interact with the visuals module, showing on screen the state of the game. Lastly, the game logic module will also be connected to the network component. This will communicate via LAN with other players. Separately, there will be a distinct map making component that allows players to create new levels. This component will create new map files that will interact with the setup module.

### • Describe the specific data you will access/store.

We will access the following data:

-Player username

-Player statistics

-Player settings

-Map file


We will store changes to the following data:

-Newly created map files

-Updated player statistics upon game conclusion

-Player settings when modified


### • What languages/toolkits do you intend to use for the development? 

We plan on using Godot to develop our product. We will use the built-in, python-like, Godot language. 

### • What is the single most serious challenge you see in developing the product on schedule?

The single most serious challenge we see in developing the product would be developing a robust and effecient means of communication between players.

### • How will you minimize or mitigate the risk?

We will minimize this risk by focusing on setting up player-to-player communications first, building the rest of the game around this feature. This way, we can secure a very effective networking component without the need to simultaneously incorporate other aspects of the game.
